# Welcome to My Corner of the Web ðŸŒ´

Hey there! Iâ€™m Saul Dolgin, and this is the official start of my public blogâ€”finally live and running on GitHub Pages. If youâ€™ve stumbled here by accident, or youâ€™re a friend, colleague, or someone curious about cloud tech, software engineering, or maybe just life in Miami Beach, youâ€™re in the right place.

## Who Am I?

Professionally, Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 25 years of hands-on experience in software development, cloud infrastructure, and the wild world of IT. These days, I work remotely from home in Miami Beach as part of Microsoftâ€™s Azure engineering team. I spend my work hours helping customers (from startups to massive enterprises) make sense of cloud platforms, infrastructure, DevOps, and how all these moving parts fit together.

But, you know, life isnâ€™t all YAML files and CI/CD pipelines. When I log off, Iâ€™m a husband, dad to two awesome sons (Lucas and Andrew), and official wrangler of two Yorkshire terriers (with a soft spot for dogsâ€”if it was practical, weâ€™d have a whole herd running around).

## What Will You Find Here?

Expect a mix of postsâ€”sometimes deep dives on cloud platforms and technical guides, sometimes practical how-tos, and occasionally some reflections on life, parenting, retirement planning (Iâ€™m aiming for 55!), and living near the beach in sunny Florida. Iâ€™ll keep things casual, practical, and (hopefully) helpful.

If youâ€™re interested in:

- **Azure** and cloud engineering tips (with the scars and war stories included)
- Technical explorations for pros and tinkerers
- Thoughtful takes on IT, remote work, and balancing work-life-family
- The odd dad joke, outdoor adventure, or Miami Beach photo

...then youâ€™ll probably enjoy hanging out here.

## Why a Blog?

Thereâ€™s no shortage of tech blogs, but I wanted a place where I could share unfiltered thoughts, walkthroughs, and hard-learned lessonsâ€”not just with customers or colleagues, but with anyone whoâ€™s trying to navigate the same waters. Consider this my open notebook, a spot for sharing, learning, and maybe starting a conversation or two.

## Letâ€™s Connect

If youâ€™re reading this, I hope youâ€™ll jump into the comments or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sdolgin). If youâ€™re an IT pro, software dev, parent, dog lover, or just someone trying to make sense of it all, drop a line. Iâ€™d love to hear from you.

Thanks for stopping by!

â€” Saul
