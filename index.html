  <p>Welcome to my personal blog! Here you'll find my latest thoughts, experiences, and insights on various topics.</p>

  <h2>What Will You Find Here?</h2>

  <p>Expect a mix of posts—sometimes deep dives on cloud platforms and technical guides, sometimes practical how-tos, and occasionally some reflections on life, parenting, retirement planning, and living near the beach in sunny Florida. I’ll keep things casual, practical, and (hopefully) helpful.</p>

  <p>If you’re interested in:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Azure</strong> and cloud engineering tips (with the scars and war stories included)</li>
    <li>Technical explorations for pros and tinkerers</li>
    <li>Thoughtful takes on IT, remote work, and balancing work-life-family</li>
    <li>The odd dad joke, outdoor adventure, or Miami Beach photo</li>
  </ul>

  <p>...then you’ll probably enjoy hanging out here.</p>
